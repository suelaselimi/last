                <p>High school was a time of self-discovery, challenges, and growth. It was filled with early mornings,
                    homework, and new
                    friendships, but also moments of laughter, stress, and unforgettable experiences. There were high
                    points like sports
                    events, dances, and academic achievements, along with low points like tough exams or navigating
                    social pressures.
                    Despite the ups and downs, it was a time of learning—about the world, relationships, and oneself.
                    High school shaped who
                    we were then and laid the foundation for who we would become.</p>

                    The trip to the science internship in Santa Cruz focused on computer science and engineering was an
                    exciting and
                    transformative experience. It provided an opportunity to dive deep into the world of technology,
                    learning from experts
                    in the field and engaging with cutting-edge projects. The internship offered hands-on experience in
                    areas like software
                    development, data analysis, and systems engineering. Working alongside passionate professionals, we
                    gained invaluable
                    insights into how computer science and engineering are applied to real-world challenges. The
                    picturesque setting of
                    Santa Cruz added to the experience, offering moments of inspiration and reflection amidst the beauty
                    of the coast. It
                    was a perfect blend of academic growth and practical application, leaving us with new skills,
                    lasting connections, and a
                    deeper appreciation for the field of tech.

                <p>I began my coding journey with HTML and CSS, learning to structure and style webpages. As I explored
                    JavaScript, I
                    gained the ability to create interactive websites.
                    WordPress allowed me to build and customize websites easily. Each language taught me valuable
                    skills, from web design to
                    problem-solving, and together they shaped my understanding of creating dynamic and functional
                    digital experiences. </p>

                <p>Learning Python has been an exciting experience. Its simple syntax made it easy to pick up, and I
                    quickly began writing
                    scripts to automate tasks and solve problems. As I dove deeper, I explored libraries like Pandas for
                    data analysis and
                    Flask for web development. Python has not only enhanced my coding skills but also sparked my
                    interest in fields like
                    data science and automation, opening up endless possibilities for projects and problem-solving.
